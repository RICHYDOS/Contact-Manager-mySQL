# Contact Manager_SQL Backend

Welcome to the Contact-Manager-SQL backend API - a project for storing customers' basic information. During the development of this project, I gained valuable experience in two crucial areas: database management and error handling.

To begin with, I discovered how to work with the MYSQL database through both raw SQL queries and the powerful ORM npm package "Sequelize". Currently, the project uses Sequelize to interact with MYSQL, but I've also included examples of raw SQL queries in comments for those who prefer it.

Furthermore, I dived deeper into error handling - an essential aspect of any backend API. While I typically use the "asynchandler" npm package to manage errors in the request response cycle, this project allowed me to gain a deeper understanding of the underlying processes."
